# Why Open Props UI?

CSS is capable of so much now, the problem is to structure a project in order for it to make sense and scale. Projects like Material UI and Tailwind/UnoCSS do a good job of nudging you towards a **happy path**, and that is the goal here.

From there you can take it anywhere you want - the code is yours to own and change.

## Why not just use Open Props?

Becuase it's not a component library, just a set of, well... props. Without much context. That's very powerful since it allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with them.
